# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description 

The starter version of the Horiseon webpage was fine visually however is was missing key accessibility features. Inspection of the index.html & style.css files revealed that the page was missing key accessibility features, additionally some of the code was unnecessary and could be 'coded out' for the page to render as intended whilst improving overall efficiency.

In order to improve accessibility and enhance the user experience for those relying on accessibility features, I have reviewed both HTML and CSS developing a more accessible webpage with more streamlined code.


During this project I learned about;
<ul>
    <li><strong>Semantic Elements</strong> to improve accessibility & accurately describe the purpose of the elements on a web page.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML Comments</strong> as a means of describing code to help explain what the code is doing.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Simplification</strong> to 'code-out' unnessary code and make it more streamlined.</li>
</ul>


### Result - <br>
<i>The webpage is now more accessible to everyone & should also benefit from imroved SEO as a result of the changes implemented!</i>


### Here is the deployed site;

## Usage 
In order to comply with accessibility guidelines, each image was given an alt tag and description, see example below;

![alt text](./assets/images/screenshot-1.jpg)

Comments have been added to the index.html to explain what the html is doing in key segments. Generic div tags were also replaced with appropriate HTML tags, such as "main", "section", "aside" etc.
